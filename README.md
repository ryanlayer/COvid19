## Setup
- Set up conda environment
```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate COvid19
```

- Download Facebook Population (Tile Level) files to `pop_tiles/orig`

- Download City/County shapefiles to `facebook/shapefiles/` (update `snake_config.json` as necessary)

- Change file paths in `snake_config.json` to match your system
- Change `base_path` in `Snakefile`

Run
```
$ python __init__.py
```

## Methods
On March 24th, 2020 at 1800 MNT, our team started collecting data from Facebook
Data for Good (https://dataforgood.fb.com/) that covers Utah and Colorado.
Facebook provides aggregated and anonymized user density data for 2km x  2km
tiles at three timepoints per day (0200 MNT, 1000 MNT, and 16000 MNT). To help
protect privacy, density data is not reporting when a tile has fewer than 10
users. In addition to the current density data, which is referred to as the
crisis density, Facebook also gives the baseline density for each tile and time
point that is the average density of that tile at the day and time for the 6
weeks prior to the start of the crisis (March 25th, 2020).

With 78 observations per tile and counting, we can track changes in population
density over time to infer behavior. For example, comparing crisis and baseline
densities can show how patterns have changed after stay-at-home orders were
issued and comparing one crisis week to the next can show if the new patterns
are holding.

last time point shown is March 18, 2020, at 1000 MNT, but we continue to
collect new data. Each day (shaded grey) includes time points at 0200, 1000,
and 1800. Weekends are darkened.*

## Weekend Score (![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=ws))

Most regions show a regular weekly pattern. Economic centers are denser on the
weekdays, residential areas are denser on the weekends, and recreational areas
are more consistent. To measure these differences we developed the weekend
score ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=ws) that
compares the average weekday density
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=d_{wd})
to the average weekend density 
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=d_{we})

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=ws=\log_2(d_{wd}/d_{we}))

Areas with higher positive values have more weekday activity and areas with
lower negative values have more weekend activity.

We can track changes in behavior by comparing the scores between weeks.

We can also track the change in the behavior of individual tiles. In the plots
below, each point is a tile and its size corresponds to the mean baseline
density. Points further to the left or higher indicate more weekday activity.
The closer a point is to the red trend line, the more similar the activity
between the two weeks. This plot also shows a change from the baseline toward
more consistent behavior between the weekdays and weekends.

*A comparison of how weekend scores change between weeks. Here, each point is a
tile and the point size corresponds to the population density of the tile.
Larger points are denser than smaller points. Larger positive values (right and
up) indicated more weekday activity and negative values (left and down)
indicate more weekend activity. The red diagonal line is a reference to judge
the change between weeks. The closer a point is to the line the more similar
the weekday/weekend behavior was between the weeks.*

## Slip score (ss) (![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=ss))

The behavior of a region after a stay-at-home order is issued depends on the
regionâ€™s demographics, which complicates monitoring. For example, economic
centers will be less dense, and residential centers will be denser since most
people are not working or traveling. To track how well regions are adhering to
their new patterns we developed a slip score 
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=ss). 
This metric assumes that adherence to these orders is best immediately
following their issuance, then tracks changes by comparing the average weekly
density 
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=d_i)
 of consecutive weeks,

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=ss=\log_2(d_2/d_1))

Areas with higher positive values are more active in the second week, and areas with lower negative values are less active.

*Current population densities for two tiles. Average weekly activity levels given by black bars. The slip from week one to week two in the top plot is 0.26 and in the slip for the same interval in the bottom plot is -0.12.*

To track individual regions, we can visualize the slip score with respect to the region size. In the plots below, each point is a tile, and points from denser regions are to the right are. Points above the zero line have slipped into a more active state, and points below the line have become less active.

## Trends

Density data can be represented as a time series with repeating short-term
patterns (seasons) and the overall value increases or decreases (trends). Using
a model, we can decompose a series into its seasons and trends, which provides
a means to compare tiles with different weekday/weekend activities (seasons).

*Density data from four tiles decomposed into their patterns and trends.*

Even within a city, we can observe the differences in density dynamics between
the business centers, which should be less dense during a stay-at-home order,
and residential centers, which should be denser. To capture the overall trend
of a city, we take the mean of each tileâ€™s trend weighted by the tileâ€™s
baseline density.

## Hot spots (![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=hs))

Assuming that stay-at-home adherence was at its best the week after an order
was issued (week 1), then we define "hot spots" as regions with significantly
higher density levels relative to that baseline.  To reduce the effects of
outliers we use a 3-day mean, and to control for weekend/weekday effects we
match days of the week when comparing current and week one values.

The hot-spot (![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=hs))
score for a tile is the difference between the current 3-day mean
(![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\overline{\mu_c}))
and the 3-day mean from the same starting day in the first week
(![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\overline{\mu_0}))
divided by standard deviation of 3-day means for other similarly dense tiles
(![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\hat{\sigma})).

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(\overline{\mu_c}-\overline{\mu_0})/\hat{\sigma})

![](imgs/colorado_hotspot_scores.png)

*Hot spot scores for three tiles. The hot spot score (blue) is the difference between the current 3-day mean(black horizontal) and the week one 3-day mean with the same start day divided by the variance (black vertical). The three examples here show a hot spot (a significant increase over week one), a neutral spot (no significant change from week one), and a cold spot (a significant decrease over week one).*
```

    --height 3 \
    --ymin -7 \
    --ymax 7

```


We are using a broader set of tiles to calculate
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\hat{\sigma})
because we have been collecting data for only a few weeks, and we have
relatively few observations for a given tile. To increase the number of samples
used to calculate the standard deviation, we fit a linear model to the mean
density and standard deviation of all tiles, then use that model to predict the
variance for the current tile.

Hot spot scores can either as plotted as a histogram, with respect to baseline
density, or as a map (via shapefile).

## Interactive Data Browser

![](imgs/SLC_data_browser.png)

We have also developed an interactive data browser that links these metrics to
maps using [plotyly dash](https://plotly.com/dash/). Code and details on
getting the server running are in the `dash` folder.

Here is a short demo video
